(tsv = tab seperated value).

===Structure of zipfile ===

 * * Folder per month (based on month numbers, 01=January, 12=December)
 * * * Folder per day (based on day numbers)

To keep its download size manageable this zipfile does NOT contain the newspaper page scans (JP2 files) and editions in PDF format you can find on the Delpher site. The metadata (didl.xml) contains persistent URLs of the JP2 files (syntax: http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=<identifier>:<pagenumber>:image) and PDF files (syntax: http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=<identifier>:pdf). From these URLs you can download the files yourself.
